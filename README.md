# React Native Checkout Screen

This is a simple React Native project built with Expo. It shows a restaurant checkout screen with menu items, delivery method selection, a promo code section, and a summary of the order. The goal was to build a clean, responsive UI similar to what you'd see in modern food delivery apps.

## What's in this project

- A working UI that:
  - Displays restaurant info (name, image, address, hours)
  - Lists cart items with quantity, image, and price
  - Lets users remove items or apply a promo code
  - Shows a price breakdown (subtotal, tax, discount, total)
- Reusable components like `RestaurantHeader`, `MenuItem`, `PriceSummary`, etc.
- Smooth layout animations when removing items or applying promos

## Tech stack

- **React Native (via Expo)** â€“ quick setup and testing on mobile
- **TypeScript** â€“ added for type safety and clarity
- **Axios** â€“ to fetch mock API data (cart and working hours)
- **KeyboardAwareScrollView** â€“ to handle form inputs and keyboard overlaps
- **LayoutAnimation** â€“ for subtle UI transitions

---

## Why this setup

Kept the architecture simple and component-based to keep things readable and easy to maintain. Everythingâ€™s structured into small parts (like menu item cards or the price summary), and the cart data is managed with React state. LayoutAnimation adds a nice touch when items change, though it can be tricky inside scroll views, that took some trial and error.
